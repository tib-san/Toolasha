# Toolasha Refactoring Summary

**Date:** January 3, 2026

## Changes Completed

### ✅ Priority 1: Delete Dead Code
**Deleted files:**
- `src/utils/game-mechanics-audit.js` (533 lines) - Zero imports, completely unused
- `src/utils/debug-enhancement-speed.js` (348 lines) - Zero imports, completely unused

**Impact:** 881 lines removed

---

### ✅ Priority 2: Consolidate Settings System
**Problem:** Settings were defined in TWO places with 100% duplication:
- `config.js` had full settingsMap definition (280 lines, lines 42-321)
- `settings-config.js` had the same settings as the UI source of truth

**Solution:**
- **Removed** settingsMap definition from `config.js`
- **Replaced** with empty object: `this.settingsMap = {}`
- **Updated** `loadSettings()` to load from `settings-storage.js`
- **Updated** `saveSettings()` to save via `settings-storage.js`
- **Added** import: `import settingsStorage from '../features/settings/settings-storage.js'`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/core/config.js`: 785 → 492 lines (293 lines removed, 37% reduction)

**How It Works Now:**
```
Single Source of Truth Flow:
settings-config.js (defines all settings with defaults)
    ↓
settings-storage.js (loads from config, merges with saved values)
    ↓
config.js (loads settingsMap from settings-storage)
    ↓
Features check config.getSetting(key) or config.isFeatureEnabled(key)
```

**Impact:** 280 lines removed + eliminated duplication maintenance burden

---

### ✅ Priority 5: Features Registry - Decision to Keep
**Investigated:** Whether `config.features` registry (lines 45-229, ~185 lines) is still needed

**Findings:**
- **IS being used** by feature-registry.js for initialization health checks
- **IS being used** by networth feature for runtime checks
- **IS exposed** in public API (main.js: `Toolasha.features`)
- **Provides value:** Maps feature keys → setting keys (abstraction layer)

**Decision:** **Keep the features registry**
- Still serves a purpose
- Used by multiple systems
- Part of public API
- Not redundant despite settings consolidation

## Overall Impact

### Lines Saved
| Category | Before | After | Saved | % Reduction |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Dead code | 881 | 0 | 881 | 100% |
| config.js | 785 | 492 | 293 | 37% |
| **Total Source** | **25,648** | **24,564** | **1,084** | **4.2%** |
| **Dist Bundle** | **23,705** | **23,407** | **298** | **1.3%** |

### Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Eliminated dead code
- ✅ Removed 100% duplication in settings system
- ✅ Single source of truth for settings (settings-config.js)
- ✅ Cleaner config.js (37% smaller)
- ✅ Easier to maintain (only edit settings in one place)

## Remaining Work (See REFACTOR_TODO.md)

### Priority 3: MutationObserver Optimization (Pending)
- 8 files create separate observers
- Migration to centralized dom-observer.js
- Expected: ~15-20% less DOM observation overhead
- **Risk:** Medium - DOM observation is critical
- **Time:** 1-2 hours

### Priority 4: Extract Shared Action Calculations (Pending)
- ~400-500 lines duplicated between:
  - `quick-input-buttons.js` (1,181 lines)
  - `action-time-display.js` (950 lines)
- Create new `utils/action-calculator.js`
- **Risk:** HIGH - high-traffic user-facing features
- **Time:** 2-3 hours + extensive testing

---

## Testing Checklist

After refactoring, verify:
- [x] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Settings UI loads correctly
- [ ] Settings persist after refresh
- [ ] Color customization still works
- [ ] All features initialize properly
- [ ] No console errors on page load
- [ ] Settings save/load between sessions

---

## Files Removed
1. `src/utils/game-mechanics-audit.js` ❌ DELETED
2. `src/utils/debug-enhancement-speed.js` ❌ DELETED

## Files Modified
1. `src/core/config.js` - Major refactor (785 → 492 lines)
   - Added import for settings-storage
   - Removed settingsMap definition
   - Updated loadSettings() method
   - Updated saveSettings() method

## Backup Created
- `src/core/config.js.backup` - Original before refactoring (can be deleted after testing)

---

## Migration Notes for Future Reference

### How Settings Work Now:
1. **Definition:** All settings defined ONCE in `src/features/settings/settings-config.js`
2. **Loading:** `settings-storage.js` builds settings map from config, merges saved values
3. **Runtime:** `config.js` loads settingsMap via `settingsStorage.loadSettings()`
4. **Saving:** `config.js` saves via `settingsStorage.saveSettings(settingsMap)`
5. **Persistence:** IndexedDB via `core/storage.js`

### Adding a New Setting:
**Before (OLD - Don't do this):** Add setting to BOTH `config.js` settingsMap AND `settings-config.js`

**After (NEW - Correct way):**
1. Add setting ONLY to `settings-config.js` in appropriate group
2. That's it\! Config will load it automatically

Example:
```javascript
// In settings-config.js
myGroup: {
    title: 'My Group',
    icon: '⚙️',
    settings: {
        myNewSetting: {
            id: 'myNewSetting',
            label: 'My New Feature',
            type: 'checkbox',
            default: true,
            help: 'Description of what this does'
        }
    }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Test refactored code in-game (user testing needed)
2. ⏭️ Consider Priority 3 (MutationObserver) if performance is an issue
3. ⏭️ Consider Priority 4 (Action Calculator) for maintainability

**Note:** Priorities 3 and 4 are documented in `REFACTOR_TODO.md` with full implementation plans.
